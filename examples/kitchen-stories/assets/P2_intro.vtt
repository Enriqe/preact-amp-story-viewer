Hi, I'm Jaime.

00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.802 line:73%
Today we're going to be
talking about how to cook

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:04.771 line:73%
crispy chicken thighs
in a cast-iron skillet.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.940 line:73%
I love doing this in the cast 
iron because you get

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.275 line:73%
extra crispy chicken skin 
and everything else you're 

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.411 line:73%
cooking gets to cook 
in that chicken fat, 

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.847 line:73%
which makes for really 
great whole food cooking.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.315 line:73%
It's also really flexible,

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.283 line:73%
so whatever's in season, go 
down to the farmer's market

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.719 line:73%
and you can use whatever 
ingredients you find there. 

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.121 line:73%
It's also pretty 
low maintenance,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.789 line:73%
so there's not a lot of 
hands-on cooking time,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.657 line:73%
so it's pretty easy for beginners.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.159 line:73%
Let's get started! 👩‍🍳

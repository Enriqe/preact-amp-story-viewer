00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.168 line:95%
So now that everything
is out of the oven,

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.570 line:95%
we have our chicken
resting over here

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.705 line:95%
and we're just going to give
it a little squeeze of lemon

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:06.806 line:95%
over the top.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:10.176 line:95%
And with our green beans
still in the hot cast iron,

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.411 line:95%
we're going to
add a little bit of

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.613 line:95%
Korean fermented
chili sauce: Gochujang.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.316 line:95%
This is sort of a choose
'choose your own adventure'

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.052 line:95%
however spicy or
non-spicy you want.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.054 line:95%
I like it kind of spicy.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.455 line:95%
Then just mix it in there,

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.091 line:95%
you've got some chicken
fat and other flavors.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.694 line:95%
Depending on how well
your beans have cooked,

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.029 line:95%
you may need to pop
it back in the oven,

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.097 line:95%
but I like them kind of crisp.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:37.470 line:95%
Yeah, these ones are good. 😋

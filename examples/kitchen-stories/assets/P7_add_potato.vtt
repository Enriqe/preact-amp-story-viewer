remove from the oven]</i>

See how nice and
crispy the skin is now? 👏

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:15.887 line:95%
It's awesome. 🤩

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.423 line:95%
So what I'm actually
going to do is

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:21.059 line:95%
take these out for a second.

<i>[Add the potatoes]</i>

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.736 line:95%
I like to make sure that
they're skin side down,

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:43.047 line:95%
so that the white fleshy bit
doesn't get too stuck to the pan.

00:00:43.552 --> 00:00:48.256 line:95%
<i>[Place the chicken on top
of the potatoes, skin-side up]</i>

00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:56.533 line:95%
<i>[Return to the oven and
cook for another 15 minutes]</i>
